# ** There was one female (E_Gkgg) which was on the eggs before and after but not ON the initiation date. I suspect I missed her in the field or she may have left and come back. In any case she was never visited and deserted 20 days after initiation and we have plenty such data points, so I think it's safe to ignore.

Most females laid their first eggs by initiating their own clutch while some females started by visiting an existing clutch (n=`r n_start_by_init` and `r n_start_by_visit` respectively). 


Visits by secondary females were typically short (median = X days) and only 2 visitors remained through hatching (Figure 2B). 
```{r}
visited_1st_4d_data_tb %>%
  filter(!females_removed,
         !mom_at_init,
         visit_ends < last_day_fID) %>%
  summarize(n = n(),
            n_NA = sum(is.na(guard_duration)),
            mean_gd = mean(as.numeric(guard_duration, "days"), na.rm=T),
            med_gd = median(as.numeric(guard_duration, "days"), na.rm=T))
```

## Figure 3
*Figure 3. The distribution of desertion times relative to hatching* (desertion date â€“ hatch date) for females on the first clutch they initiated in the ant exclusion (black) and control (red) enclosures, for clutches that were not visited by a secondary female within 4 days of initiation (A) and for clutch that were visited by a secondary female within 4 days of initiation (B). Desertion time = 0 (dashed) is the day nymphs were first observed, and desertion time = -20 (dotted) is the mean initiation date relative to hatching.

## Figure 4
*Figure 4. The guarding duration (days) of initiating females who were first visited by a secondary female on different numbers of days after initiation.* Day 0 represents females that were visited on the first day eggs were observed (i.e. more than one female was on the clutch when eggs were first observed). Violin plots show the density of observations. Letters signify factor levels that are not significantly different (p-value < 0.05 from a Dunn test after multiple testing correction using the Holm-Bonferroni method). The colors indicate whether the clutch was visited (orange) or not (green) within the first 4 days after initiation.
